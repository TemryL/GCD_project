Everything is explained in Report.pdf but to recap:

Given a set of files collected by a real‚Äêworld entity with data about comic books (available in Part_1/GCD_2022) the goal was to design the database schema and implement the relational schema, parse and load the data into a DBMS, write queries, and finally evaluate and optimize queries with index structures/query plan analysis.
